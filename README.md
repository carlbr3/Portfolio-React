## Description
The purpose of building this simple portfolio is to highlight the use of React. There are links to my existing portfolio, highlighting some of the projects completed in this bootcamp.  There is also a link to my resume, and a list of tools learned in this bootcamp. Please complete the contact form for any question you may have! I am hoping that this provides a clear example that I'm capable of writing code and displaying the tools learned in this bootcamp to a future employer. Happy Coding!

## Installation
Download the code, run with `npm i`. Then you will need to use `npm run dev`. This will display a the developer version for this portfolio.  You can view the deployed portfolio version [here](https://6799bd8a3713b6002c31a938--netlify-deployment-portfolio-react.netlify.app).
